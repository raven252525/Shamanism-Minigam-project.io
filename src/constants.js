    talking_tree:`You bump into a tree and it begins to speak, 
    “Herbal medicine most often focuses on treating digestive ailments 
    because they are especially common, and plants naturally produce antimicrobials 
    and antifungals for humans to use.” You remember this tree and his words well, but why?`,
    counter_intuitive: `Aha! You realize the talking tree is minimally counterintuitive. 
    Concepts with 1-2 elements that violate our intuitive expectations

    Crocky: `Uh oh. A spirit, a supernatural entity that exists independent of a 
    physical body, crosses your path and almost scares you to death! In nearly every 
    society, people attribute some illnesses to spirits, and unfortunately, 
    you develop the Ukrainian disease liak (“fear sickness”) as a result of the scare. 
    You are paranoid, extremely nervous, and begin to experience panic attacks. 
    You gotta keep moving forward`,
    wise_trees: ` The wise trees urge you to seek the help of babka. `,
    chest: ` You have reached babka’s hut! Babka, or “granny”, 
    is a Ukrainian folk healer who performs magico-religious rituals to treat a variety 
    of physical and spiritual illnesses, such as evil eye, curses, and fortunately for you, 
    liak! Maybe she can help? `,
    babka: `Babka examines you thoroughly and decides to perform the magic wax ritual. 
    She gives you comforting words, holds a bowl of cold water over your head, 
    pours wax into it while repeating incantations, then loosens the hardened wax with a 
    knife and interprets the shapes. She remelts the wax and performs the ritual twice more, 
    holding the bowl over your shoulders, then your knees and hands. After the final pouring, 
    she washes you with water and prays to God, Jesus, and the Holy spirit. 
    You feel much better! `,
    scholar: `You found the scholar! He annoyingly decides to explain to you why Babka’s magic works. 
    “Her rituals have many steps, much repetition, and involve religious figures. 
    This increases your intuition of efficacy of her magic!” Thanks, I guess?
